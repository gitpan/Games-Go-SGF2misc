Oh, great... yet another SGF parser?

1) Yeah.  Well, Games::Go::SGF didn't really do what I want.  
2) sgf2misc is *gasp* closed source (mostly)
3) I wanted to learn SGF
4) Parse::Lex is neat
5) This one uses GD!
6) This one produces data that you can use in your own programs!
   as_hash() returns a cool perl structure that should be pretty
   obvious to use.  as_perl() spits out sources (bless
   Data::Dumper) and I don't think I could have done them with
   the obvious choice, Games::Go::SGF.

I'm tired of enumerating.  Basically, this module reads in SGFs
and produces useable output in dozens (1 so far) of formats.

Later:

I really wanted to use a Grammer with the Lexer.  Turns out,
Games::Go::SGF uses a grammer with Parse::RecDescent.  Suddenly I
begin to wonder why I didn't just use that module afterall.  Heh.  
But in the end, it's parser isn't going to turn out my cool hash.


Mo Latah:

I wish to design a cool plugin heirachry so I can install all the
cool as_something()s that are bound to pour in as fast as
spamcop.net can filter them.
