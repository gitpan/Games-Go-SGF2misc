GD NOTE: 

I don't include GD/GD::Image in the PREREQ_PM, but you will need 
it to use the as_image() function.


Parse::Lex NOTE:

If you are having trouble with Parse::Lex, then know that you are
not alone.  It seemed to compile on my devel computer, but
NOWHERE else. :)

There is a ParseLex-2.15.patch including in this distro.  Try it.




Oh, great... yet another SGF parser?

1) Yeah.  Well, Games::Go::SGF didn't really do what I want.  
2) sgf2misc is *gasp* closed source (mostly)
3) I wanted to learn SGF
4) Parse::Lex is neat
5) This one uses GD (well, will use)!
6) This one produces data that you can use in your own programs!
   as_perl() and node_list() returns cool perl structures that
   you can use in your own programs.  I don't think I could have
   done this stuff with the obvious choice, Games::Go::SGF.

I'm tired of enumerating.  Basically, this module reads in SGFs
and produces useable output in dozens (2 so far) of formats.


Later:

I really wanted to use a Grammer with the Lexer.  Turns out,
Games::Go::SGF uses a grammer with Parse::RecDescent.  Suddenly I
begin to wonder why I didn't just use that module afterall.  Heh.  

I am now aware, that I have re-invented the wheel.  *sigh*

Oh well!  Have fun!
